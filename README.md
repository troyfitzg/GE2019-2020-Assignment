### Description 

For my assignment , I decided to create an infinite runner game that uses audio to react with and change the enviroment, similar to [Thumper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumper_(video_game)).


![Thumper Game](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi88J3A1qblAhVRT8AKHQynDJgQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvfOwkFvumuk&psig=AOvVaw2AC3cJhaoYLyRDEpz8tXmI&ust=1571517889760605)

The game will use procedural generation to create the enviroment for the player to move along.
