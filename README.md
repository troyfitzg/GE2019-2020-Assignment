### Description 

For my assignment , I decided to create an infinite runner game that uses audio to react with and change the environment, similar to [Thumper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumper_(video_game)).

The game will use procedural generation to create the enviroment for the player to move along. 

The audio will react with things like obstacles and the overall environment, changing the color and shape.

The player will control a character that moves automatically forward, the player must move from left to right along lanes avoiding obstacles to gain a high score. As the player progresses further the characters speed will increase making the game more difficult.



### Plan 

I plan to start off by making some more detailed assets using my knowledge of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to create the environments, obstacles and the player character. I plan on making around 20 or so different enviroments that will be cycled through randomly using procedural generation to create the world for the player to move on. 

After the assets are created , I will start working on the code in Unity. I will be prioritizing the procedural generation system, making sure the environments spawn in the correct position in front of the player, and when the old environments are invisible they will be removed from the scene. 

Once this system is working correctly, I will start working on the audio visual system. This system will randomly change things such as color and terrain shifting. 

If I have time in the end, I will try to add some extra flare such as a title screen and character changing.
